## Introduction
SuperGameEngine (**SGE**) is my project to explore programming in C++ by creating a 2D Engine in SDL3.

## Documentation
Formal documentation for the Engine is below.
> [Documentation](https://docs.supergameengine.com)

## What is the plan here?
This is the most ambitious project I have ever taken on with one Goal: Make a 2D Game Engine I can make my projects in.

I want an engine to exist which works in the way I think about Game Engines and that I know will not be sold or change its business plan down the line.
There are only two ways to meet this goal, acquire the company making an engine perfectly suited to my mind or make it.
Considering I am not currently a millionaire I opted for the second option - which is more fun in my opinion ðŸ˜‰.

The plan with this is a 2D Engine to make:
1. Top down RPG Games
2. Platformers
3. Card Games
4. Visual Novels
5. Anything else you could make in 2D

When I run out of 2D games, then move on to DirectX and make Super Game Engine 3D.

## Why call it Super Game Engine?
If you have faith in something becoming amazing give it the best name in the world.
This Engine might not be the best, it will **not beat Unreal 5, Unity, Godot or GameMaker**.

What this Engine is though is my **Super Game Engine** to take my ideas to the Moon!

## Goals, Features and Plans
The best way to keep up with these are the following:
1. The documentation will have my road map when I have one: [Documentation](https://docs.supergameengine.com)
2. My social media will have posts with the engine on: [Blue Sky](https://bsky.app/profile/decent.bsky.social)
3. Dev Logs which are slower than the above will be via YouTube: [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@ScottGarryFoster)
